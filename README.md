# Bee
LetÂ´s improve the life of bees and the work of beekeeping by the aid of technology.
Installing different sensors on a beehive, monitor what is going on and take appropriate actions if needed.

The sensors are hooked up to an ESP8266-12.

Lets start with 2 sensors:
1. Temperture and humidity (DHT11/ DHT22)
2. Load cells with HX711
