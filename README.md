# Bee
LetÂ´s improve the life of bees and the work of beekeeping by the aid of technology.

The aim of this project is to be able to remotely monitor beehives. The monitorinng is done by installing different sensors in the beehive and forwarding the measurement results to a dashboard. The beekeeper then has a better understanding of what is going on in the behieve and can take appropriate actions if needed.

The sensors are hooked up to an ESP8266-12.

Lets start with 2 sensors:
1. Temperture and humidity (DHT11/ DHT22)
2. Load cells with HX711
